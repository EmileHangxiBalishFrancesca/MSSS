The final report and analysis is written by the whole team. Each team member has contributed in equal amount to the project.

\section{Introduction and Motivations}
The interaction among a group of people is always an interesting research problem. The social force model, which was proposed by Helbing\cite{Socialforce,ModificationSocialforce} in order to analyze the pedestrian behaviour, has been proved to be a successful theory to explain the reaction of individuals under the influence of surrounding environment and other people. Recent researches have used the social force model to analyze the behaviour of a pedestrian crowd\cite{crowd1,crowd2,crowd3,traffic3crowd4}, traffic\cite{traffic1,traffic2,traffic3crowd4}, and fish movement\cite{fish}. In this report, we will also use the social force model to simulate the behaviour of the people during the apero. 

An apero is a small place for people to gather together. In ETHz, there are many conferences, seminars and talks. After these meetings, an apero would usually take place for people to have a drink or eat something. People participating the apero would at first try to get food from the buffet table, and then they will gather around the pre-set tables to make conversations. A real apero in the ETH main building is shown in figure.\ref{fig:apero}.

People always tend to make the shortest path to reach their destinations. However, if there are is a group of people, the mutual interactions within them and with the obstacles in the movement directions will change their desired path, and in some cases, block their movements. We therefore want to answer the following question: in what situations, given a set of pre-deteremined parameters, people can get their food and reach tables quickly and successfully in an apero? In the report we use the social force model to simulate people's behaviours, assuming that people will have their desired movement direction right towards their destinations, but at the same time, their actual movements are affected by the environment and the other people, which are described by different social forces.
\section{Description of the Model}
To simulate the behaviors of the people during an Apero, the social force model that has been suggested by Helbing \cite{Socialforce}, is used with some modifications. This model explains the motion of people due to force fields occurring from their destination, obstacles and other people. During an Apero, all the people have destinations, either the food table or an empty table, and their motion is limited by the walls, tables and the position and motion of other people. Thus, this model is thought to be suitable for this simulation.
\subsection{Force due to desination}
In real life, people go towards their destination by facing to that point, and trying to move around a constant velocity. This force model acts like a simple proportional controller, where the inputs to this controller are the actual velocity vector and the desired velocity vector.

Desired velocity direction, $\vec{e}_\alpha$ can be defined as in Eq. \ref{develodir}, where as $\vec{r}_\alpha$ denotes the actual position,  $\vec{d}_\alpha$ indicates the position of the destination of the pedestrian $\alpha$,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{e}_\alpha(t):=\frac{\vec{d}_\alpha-\vec{r}_\alpha(t)}{\| \vec{d}_\alpha-\vec{r}_\alpha(t) \|}
\label{develodir}
\end{equation}
So the force on a pedestrian can be written as the multiplication of a constant with the difference of desired velocity vector and the actual velocity vector, as in Eq.\ref{forcedevevec}, where $\vec{v}_\alpha^0$ is the desired speed and $\vec{v}_\alpha$ is the actual speed of the pedestrian $\alpha$,
\begin{equation}
    F_\alpha^0(\vec{v}_\alpha,v_\alpha^0\vec{e}_\alpha) := \frac{1}{\tau}(v_\alpha^0\vec{e}_\alpha-\vec{v}_\alpha)
\label{forcedevevec}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Force due to other pedestrains}
Another important thing that effects the motion of a pedestrian is the behavior of the other pedestrians. People get uncomfortable due to other people mainly in 2 cases. First, if somebody is too close to them; second, if somebody is moving towards them.
By using these 2 facts, the force exerted by a person on other people is defined to be a monotonic decreasing force field with elliptical shape, where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with the velocity vector of the person who exerts the force. The monotonic decreasing part makes the force weaker when the distance between 2 people increases. The elliptical shape makes the force stronger on the points which are closer to the direction of the person's velocity. This effect can be shown as in Eq.\ref{personforcefield},
\begin{equation}
    \vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}:=-\nabla_{\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}}V_{\alpha\beta}[b(\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta})]
\label{personforcefield}
\end{equation}
$\vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}$ is the force exerted from pedestrian $\beta$ to pedestrian $\alpha$, $V_{\alpha\beta}$ is any monotonically decreasing function, $\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}$ is the position of $\beta$ with respect to $\alpha$ and $b$ is the length of the semi minor axis of the described ellipse which is defined in equation Eq.\ref{2b},
\begin{equation}
    2b:=\sqrt{(\|\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}\|+\|\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}-v_\beta\Delta t\vec{e}_{\beta}\|)^2-(v_\beta\Delta t)^2}
    \label{2b}
\end{equation}

If the force is defined like this, a person would be effected in the same way both if the other people are behind him/her, both if the people are in front of him/her. To avoid this, the calculated force is multiplied by a coefficient $w$, which is defined as : 
\begin{equation}
    w(\vec{e},\vec{f})=\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $\vec{e}\cdot\vec{f}\geq\|\vec{f}\|\cos{\phi}$}.\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is taken a value between 0 and 1.

\subsection{Force due to obstacles and walls}
People get uncomfortable as they get closer to the walls and obstacles. This effect can be visualized as a force coming from the obstacles whose magnitude increases monotonically as the distance between people and obstacles decreases. Thus, similar to the force between people, force due to walls can be described as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{\alpha B}:=-\nabla_{\vec{r}_{\alpha B}}U_{\alpha B}[b(\|\vec{r}_{\alpha B}\|)]
\end{equation}
where $ \vec{F}_{\alpha B}$ is the force between pedestrian $\alpha$ and obstacle $B$. And $U_{\alpha B}$ is any monotonically decreasing function with respect to distance between pedestrian and obstacle. Details of that function is explained under the implementation section.

\subsection{Total Force}
The resultant force at a time instant on a pedestrian is simply the sum of the force due to objective, the forces exerted by all of the obstacles/walls and the forces from every person in the room. This is shown in Eq[x+6],
\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_\alpha(t):=\vec{F}_\alpha^0(\vec{v}_\alpha,v_\alpha^0\vec{e}_\alpha)+\sum_\beta\vec{F}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{e}_\alpha,\vec{r}_\alpha-\vec{r}_\alpha)+\sum_B\vec{F}_{\alpha B}(\vec{e}_\alpha,\vec{r}_\alpha-\vec{r}_\alpha^B)
\end{equation}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Social Force Model Algorithm}
Under the description of the model section, it is explained that, it is a good idea to obtain the force from a monotonically decreasing potential field. Due to the fact that as the distance between people increases their interaction effects decrease faster than the distance, an exponentially decreasing potential is used as in Eq.\ref{personpersonpoten}.
\begin{equation}
    V_{\alpha\beta}(b)=V^0_{\alpha\beta}e^{b/\sigma}
    \label{personpersonpoten}
\end{equation}
where, $V^0_{\alpha\beta}$ is taken $2m^2s^{-2}$ and $\sigma=0.2m$. Moreover, the force between two agents is post multiplied by a constant depending on their heading direction and the angle between them. If the angle between the heading direction of a pedestrian $\alpha$ and the position vector of a pedestrian $\beta$ is more than $60^\circ$, the calculated force exerted from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ is multiplied by 0.3 to decrease the effect. One may expect to think that the force exerted from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ to be equal to the force exerted from $\beta$ to $\alpha$. However, this is sometimes not the case. For example, there are 2 people going to a same destination, one in front of the other. While there is a great force exerted from the person in front to the one behind, the force exerted from the person behind to the front one is much less.

\subsection{Wall - person repulsion}
A pedestrian wants to keep a certain distance from the borders of the obstacles in the room, like the walls, doors and pillars.

According to the description provided in the Social Force Model, the influence of the obstacles is modeled by a monotonically decreasing potential field. Focusing on our model, we described the wall-person interaction with a force inversely proportional to the distance between the them.

It must be remarked that the wall is not a point source. To describe the effect of every obstacle in space, we discretized them into several point sources at constant distance. The total repulsion force consists in the superposition of the point source contributions.

\begin{equation}
    F_{\text{wall-person}}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{k}{D^2_{p-w,i}}
\end{equation}
where, $D_{p-w,i}$ denotes the distance between a person and the wall point source. According to the simulation outcomes, the value of the proportionality person-wall constant $k$ is set to 0.0003.

The calculation of the point source contributions is numerically expensive. We exploited the fact that the wall effect is constant in time and we saved the wall impact into a file. In order to be able to save it, we discretized the Apero room into a rectangular mesh of points, at which corners the wall repulsion is calculated. The maps containing the force direction, magnitude and orientation is saved into a file, which is opened only once every simulation. 

Finally, the force impact on a person is calculated as the weighted average of the forces applied to the nearest points to a person. The average is weighted on the distance of these points and the person.

We were aware that the discretization procedure introduces a physical inaccuracy. Nevertheless, the error related to the discretization of the walls and of the room becomes negligible when the distance composing the mesh is particularly accurate.

\subsection{Table - person repulsion}
The participants to the Apero usually want to take some food before moving to a table where they can eat and chat. While they move towards the food, the tables become obstacles. Their influence on pedestrian's movement is modeled in the same way of the wall repulsive force, except that the tables are considered point sources.

As we did for the wall repulsion force, we established a table-person constant. We tested several values for this constant and eventually we set $C_t = 0.05$.

\subsection{Path towards the objective}
We assumed that the main objective of every person consists in taking the food as fast as possible and then move to the nearest table. In order to reach these two destinations, the pedestrians try to follow the shortest path.

We modeled the pedestrian's attraction to the objective with a constant pulling force pointing towards the pedestrian's goal. If there are static obstacles like walls between a person and the objective, the pedestrian follows the shortest polygonal route.
